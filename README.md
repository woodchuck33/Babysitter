# Babysitter
Expert system created using FuzzyCLIPS
Created in September 2017

This program is designed to aid caretakers of young children (0-48 months) in determining the best course of action as regards to feeding,
napping, and diaper changing of the child.  The program will accept input regarding the time of last feeding, nap, and diaper change, in
addition, it will accept the current time.  Based on these inputs, the program will use Fuzzy Logic to determine the optimal time window 
to do these tasks.  These windows were based on an expert in child care's responses during the knowledge engineering portion of this
project.

This is a project created for Dr. Scott Gordon's CSc 180 class at California State University, Sacramento.
